# PCA9685 README
This software is a devLib extension to [wiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/) and enables it to control the [Adafruit PCA9685 16-Channel 12-bit PWM/Servo Driver](http://www.adafruit.com/products/815) via I2C interface.

NOTE: The software could run faster because some write function read the current register value before they write to it, but it shouldn't matter in usual setups. If you need it super fast, you probably need to program your own write functions.

## REQUIREMENTS
Enable I2C on your Raspberry Pi and make sure your PCA9685 controller board can be found. A tutorial on how to do this can be found [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-i2c).

## INSTALL
This pca9685 library requires an installed version of wiringPi.
WiringPi comes preinstalled on standard raspbian systems so check first if it is there already. 
To do so, open a terminal and execute `gpio -v`.

If it's not installed, the easiest way is by calling `sudo apt install wiringpi`. If you need addidtional information or want to install from sources, check out [http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/](http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/). 

NOTE: WiringPi is now deprecated and will not work out of the box on newer (â‰¥Rpi4) boards, check out
[http://wiringpi.com/wiringpi-deprecated/](http://wiringpi.com/wiringpi-deprecated/)

## USAGE
You can include __pca9685.h__ and __pca9685.c__ directly in your project or compile it and include the lib file instead.
	
To compile, navigate into the src folder an run
```console
sudo make install
```
This will install pca9685 in your __/usr/lib__, __/usr/local/lib__ and __/usr/local/include__ directories.
To include the files add the line
```cpp
#include <pca9685.h>
```
into your source code and include "__wiringPiPca9685__" in your linked files during compilation

## EXAMPLES
There are some example files included in this repository. To compile them, cd into __examples__ directory and `make` them. 
To run, add a "__./__" before each example and execute them, e.g. `./servo`. 

## FUNCTIONS
Use	
```cpp
int pca9685Setup(const int pinBase, const int i2cAddress/* = 0x40*/, float freq/* = 50*/);
```
to setup a single pca9685 device at the specified i2c address and PWM frequency.

Parameters are:

	- pinBase: 		Use a pinBase > 64, eg. 300
	- i2cAddress:	The default address is 0x40
	- freq:			Frequency will be capped to range [40..1000] Hertz. Try 50 for servos

When successful, this will reserve 17 pins in wiringPi and return a file descriptor with 
which you can access advanced functions (view below).

The pca9685 pins are as follows: 

	[0...15]: The 16 individual output pins as numbered on the driver
	[16]: All pins (Note that reading from this pin returns always 0)

Use the following wiringPi functions to read and write PWM.
NOTE: Don't forget to add the pin base!


Set PWM
```cpp
void pwmWrite (int pin, int value)
```
if value <= 0, set full-off
else if value >= 4096, set full-on
else set PWM

Set full-on or full-off
```cpp
void digitalWrite (int pin, int value)
```
if value != 0, set full-on
else set full-off

Read off-register
```cpp
int digitalRead (int pin)
```
To get PWM: mask with 0xFFF
To get full-off bit: mask with 0x1000
Note: ALL_LED pin will always return 0

Read on-register
```cpp
int analogRead (int pin)
```
To get PWM: mask with 0xFFF
To get full-on bit: mask with 0x1000
Note: ALL_LED pin will always return 0



NOTE: Unfortunately wiringPi doesn't offer suitable names for pca9685's functions, so we have to work with the provided ones. 
Masking means to bitwise-AND (operator &) the return value with the mask. E.g. & 0xFFF
```cpp
int offValue = digitalRead(pinBase + 0) & 0xFFF;
```
## ADVANCED		

If you don't want to use the wiringPi functions or want to access the pca9685
directly, you can use the file descriptor returned from the setup function to access 
the following functions for each connected pca9685 individually.
(View source code for more details)

Set output frequency in a range between 40 and 1000 Hertz
```cpp
void pca9685PWMFreq(int fd, float freq);
```
Reset all PWM output of this device to default state which is full-off
```cpp
void pca9685PWMReset(int fd);
```
Write PWM on and off values to a specific pin. (View source code)
```cpp
void pca9685PWMWrite(int fd, int pin, int on, int off);
void pca9685PWMRead(int fd, int pin, int *on, int *off);
```
Write enable or disable full-on and full-off of a specific pin. (View source code)
```cpp
void pca9685FullOn(int fd, int pin, int tf);
void pca9685FullOff(int fd, int pin, int tf);
```
